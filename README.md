- **Clarity and Understanding**: It helps in understanding what the stakeholders expect from the software, reducing ambiguity.
- **Scope Definition**: Clearly defines the scope of the project, which helps in preventing scope creep.
- **Basis for Design and Development**: Provides a solid foundation for designing and developing the system.
- **Cost and Time Estimation**: Facilitates accurate estimation of project cost, resources, and time.
- **Quality Assurance**: Ensures that the final product meets the specified requirements, leading to higher customer satisfaction.
